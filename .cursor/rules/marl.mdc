# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Agent Modularity:** Design agents as independent, reusable components with clear interfaces.
- **Environment Abstraction:** Separate environment logic from agent logic using proper abstractions.
- **Policy Separation:** Keep policy networks, value networks, and communication modules separate.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages: `agents/`, `environments/`, `policies/`, `utils/`, `configs/`.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases, including multi-agent interaction scenarios.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors. Include agent-specific logging for debugging multi-agent interactions.

## 4. MARL-Specific Guidelines

### Environment Design
- **PettingZoo Compatibility:** Design custom environments following PettingZoo's API standards (`parallel_env` or `aec_env`).

- **Reward Engineering:** Implement modular reward functions with clear documentation of reward components (individual, team, global).
- **Environment Rendering:** Include visualization capabilities for debugging and analysis.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure environments are deterministic when seeded properly.

### Agent Architecture
- **Agent Abstraction:** Create base agent classes with clear interfaces for policy, learning, and communication.
- **Policy Networks:** Implement modular policy architectures (actor-critic, Q-networks, etc.) with clear separation of concerns.
- **Memory Management:** Design efficient experience replay systems for multi-agent scenarios.
- **Communication Protocols:** Implement structured communication mechanisms when agents need to exchange information.
- **Coordination Mechanisms:** Design clear interfaces for agent coordination (centralized training, decentralized execution).

### Training Infrastructure
- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` with structured configs for agents, environments, and training parameters.
- **Distributed Training:** Leverage `ray[rllib]` for scalable multi-agent training across multiple workers.
- **Curriculum Learning:** Implement progressive training strategies for complex multi-agent tasks.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations with MARL-specific types (e.g., `AgentID`, `MultiAgentObs`, `JointAction`).
- Must provide clear, Google-style docstrings with MARL context.
- Key algorithm logic should be annotated with comments explaining multi-agent considerations.
- Provide usage examples including multi-agent training loops and evaluation.
- Include error handling for common MARL scenarios (agent disconnection, environment resets, etc.).
- Use `ruff` for code formatting.
- Include type definitions for common MARL concepts:
  ```python
  from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional, Union, Tuple
  import numpy as np
  
  AgentID = str
  MultiAgentObs = Dict[AgentID, np.ndarray]
  MultiAgentAction = Dict[AgentID, Union[int, np.ndarray]]
  MultiAgentReward = Dict[AgentID, float]
  MultiAgentDone = Dict[AgentID, bool]
  MultiAgentInfo = Dict[AgentID, Dict[str, Any]]
  ```

# MARL-Specific Best Practices

- **Scalability Consideration:** Design systems that can handle varying numbers of agents.
- **Communication Overhead:** Minimize unnecessary communication between agents and training processes.
- **Evaluation Diversity:** Test agents against diverse opponents and scenarios, not just self-play.
- **Reproducibility:** Use proper seeding, deterministic operations, and version control for all components.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of agent behaviors, reward structures, and training procedures.
